Simon is a short-term memory skill game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associateswith software programming by Lenny Cope. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
